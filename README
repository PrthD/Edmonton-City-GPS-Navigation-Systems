        Makefile Targets:
                - make (run): Builds the executable server
                - make clean: Removes all object files, executable, and named pipes
                - make all: executes the compile and run targets of this makefile
                - make compile: Builds the executable server in the server directory

Running instructions:
        1. First, navigate to the server directory and open the terminal. Then, execute the command "make (server)" to compile and link
           the server-related files.

        2. Next, return to the soln folder and open the terminal. Execute "make (run)" to run both the server and the client, which
           should bring up the map of Edmonton.

        3. To select a starting point and an endpoint on the map, click on each location using the left mouse button. After doing so,
           the shortest path between the two points will appear as a colored line.

        4. Use the "w-s-d-a" keys to navigate through the map, and use "q/e" to zoom in or out respectively.

        5. Once finished, execute "make clean" in the soln directory to restore all the directories to their default state. This step
           must be followed after every executions of program to avoid errors.

Notes and Assumptions:
        The files dijkstra.cpp, digraph.cpp, digraph.h, wdigraph.h, dijkstra.h, and edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt in the subdirectory server
    and client.py in the subdirectory client are completely unchanged. The file server.cpp contains all the implementation for part 2 of
    the assignment-Navigation System.

        It is important to follow steps 1-5 correctly when running the program, as failure to do so will result in the program not
    working as intended. Additionally, note that the program is only configured to be run on Linux-based operating systems. When the
    second point is selected on the map, the server will send an 'E', and when the map window is closed, the server will send a 'Q'.

        The soln/Makefile does not check whether the server executable has been made, hence it is a must to create the server executable
    prior to running the makefile. Also, if user attempts to manually run the client program before the server program, the program will
    fail.
